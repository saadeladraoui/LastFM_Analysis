# Last FM scrobbles analysis

In depth analysis of my lastfm scrobbles of the lst 6 years to discover my listening habits and trends in the music I listen to. 

This project is in Python and I use mainly Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualization.

I use external sources to enrich my scrobbles data such as the Musicbrainz API to get information about artists and Spotify API to get features about songs.

### Steps followed

I divided the project into 4 differents steps that I put on IPython notebooks.

+ Part 1 - Scraping of Lastfm data and first exploration

+ Part 2 - Listening habits and Types of music

+ Part 3 - Geomapping of scrobbles

+ Part 4 - Listening experience through using Spotify API
