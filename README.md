# Last FM scrobbles analysis

In depth analysis of my lastfm scrobbles of the last 6 years to discover my listening habits and trends in the music I listen to. 

This project is in Python and I use mainly Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for viaualization.

I use external sources to enrich my scrobbles data such as the Musicbrainz API to get information about artists and Spotify API to get features about songs.

You can find the data I worked with in the data directory in the form of pickled pandas dataframes.

### Project parts

I divided the project into 4 differents steps that I put on IPython notebooks.
